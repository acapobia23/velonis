    <h3>Discover the peaceful hills surrounding Florence</h3>
    <p>
    Discover the peaceful hills surrounding Florence with our E-Bike Experience, starting directly from Villa dei Lari, the historic Strozziâ€“Machiavelli residence in Marignolle â€” just a 15-minute walk from Porta Romana.<br>
    During this relaxed ride, you'll be accompanied by a member of our staff who will guide you safely along the roads of Marignolle and Arcetri, two of the most scenic areas near Florence.<br>
    This is not a guided tour, but rather a pleasant outdoor activity designed for our guests to enjoy the Tuscan landscape at their own pace.<br><br>

      <p><strong>This is a free Information & Booking Service!</strong></p>

<p>
  For our clients we recommend 4 top-quality pasta courses that are both fun and educational.
</p>

<p>
  Prices range from €70 to €97 per person during high season and around €50 per person during low season.<br>
  All cooking schools are nestled within the historic center in areas worth exploring.
</p>

<p>
  If you'd like to book or get more information, just drop us a line using the contacts at the bottom of the page.<br>
  We guarantee bookings at the best available price on their official websites.
</p>

<p>
  Once you receive your booking confirmation, you'll pay the school directly on the day of the experience<br>
  or via a convenient link we'll send you from the cooking school to your preferred contact!
</p>

<p>
  The schools we work with trust our clients, so if you need to cancel,<br>
  just follow the cancellation policy timelines we'll communicate to you – they're pretty flexible, too!

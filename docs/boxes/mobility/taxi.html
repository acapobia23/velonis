    <p>Taxi and Uber in Florence</p>
    <p>Taxis are licensed and can be found at stands near major landmarks or booked by phone or via apps like <a href="https://apptaxi.it/en/florence/#download_modal">AppTaxi</a> and <a href="https://www.taximove.it/en/">TaxiMove</a>, especially during high season (May–June and September–October) and at peak hours, such as around 10:00 AM when many hotel check-outs happen, Please note, however, that the two main taxi companies don’t always accept advance bookings at all times. In some cases, they may only allow you to call for a taxi at the exact moment you need it. This also depends on the season and the time of day.
For advance bookings, sending a message via WhatsApp is often the most reliable and secure method.<br>
    They are reliable, but availability may vary, so it’s best to book in advance, especially early or late.</p>

    <p>The Uber app works in Florence only for Uber Black (private NCC drivers), not standard ride‑share.<br>
    It offers up‑front booking and licensed drivers but is more expensive than taxis.</p><br><br>
    <p>If you're unable to find a taxi, don’t forget you can also check the Private Van section on our website.</p>
